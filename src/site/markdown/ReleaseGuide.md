## Releasing Apache Twill

This guide describes the steps to building and releasing Apache Twill artifacts.

### Environment Setup

#### Generate GPG keypair
Generate a GPG keypair for signing artifacts, if you don't already have one.
See [GPG key generation](http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#generate-key) on how to do so.
Make sure the public key is published to a public key server, as well as added to the Twill
[KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/twill/KEYS) file.

#### Generate an encrypted password for maven deploy
Generate an encrypted password for your apache id using maven
(see [Maven Encryption Guide](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html)) and
add the following section to your Maven settings (`~/.m2/settings.xml`):

```xml
<server>
  <id>apache.releases.https</id>
  <username>[APACHE_USER_ID]</username>
  <password>[ENCRYPTED_APACHE_PASSWORD]</password>
</server>
```

### Release procedure

#### Create a new release branch from master
```
git checkout -b branch-${RELEASE_VERSION}
```
The `${RELEASE_VERSION}` is something such as `0.11.0`. 

#### Update the version to the non-snapshot version
```
mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=${RELEASE_VERSION}
git commit . -m "Prepare for releasing ${RELEASE_VERSION}"
```

#### Create a new signed tag for the release
```
git tag -s v${RELEASE_VERSION} -m 'Releasing ${RELEASE_VERSION}'
```
  
#### Push both the new branch and the tag
```
git push origin branch-${RELEASE_VERSION}
git push origin v${RELEASE_VERSION}
```

#### Start gpg-agent
* Run `gpg-agent` to save the number of times that you have to type in your GPG password
  when building release artifacts.
* You can run `gpg -ab` to confirm the the agent is
  running and it has cached your password correctly.
* Alternatively, if you don't want to
  run GPG agent, you can specify your GPG password through
  `-Dgpg.passphrase=[GPG_PASSWORD]` when running Maven.
  
#### Build the source tarball and publish artifacts to the staging repo
```
mvn clean deploy -DskipTests -Dremoteresources.skip=true -P hadoop-2.6 -P apache-release
```
The source tarball can be found in `target/apache-twill-${RELEASE_VERSION}-source-release.tar.gz`
after the above command has successfully completed.
  
#### Compute the MD5 and SHA512 of the source release tarball
```
cd target
md5 -q apache-twill-${RELEASE_VERSION}-source-release.tar.gz > apache-twill-${RELEASE_VERSION}-source-release.tar.gz.md5
shasum -a 512 apache-twill-${RELEASE_VERSION}-source-release.tar.gz > apache-twill-${RELEASE_VERSION}-source-release.tar.gz.sha512
```
  
#### Prepare release artifacts
1. Checkin the source release tarball, together with the signature, md5 and sha512 files
   to `dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/twill/${RELEASE_VERSION}-rc1/src/`
1. Create a `CHANGES.txt` file to describe the changes in the release and checkin the file
   to `dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/twill/${RELEASE_VERSION}-rc1/CHANGES.txt`
1. Go to [https://repository.apache.org](https://repository.apache.org) and close the staging repository.

#### Increase the version in master
```
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff branch-${RELEASE_VERSION}
mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=${NEXT_RELEASE_VERSION}-SNAPSHOT
git commit . -m "Bump version to ${NEXT_RELEASE_VERSION}-SNAPSHOT"
git push origin master
```

#### Vote for release in dev mailing list
Create a vote in the `dev@twill` mailing list and wait for 72 hours for the vote result.
Here is a template for the email:

```
